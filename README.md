<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We believe that sports are for everyoneâ€”not just the chosen few! Our project is designed to support local sports league owners and participants in conveniently managing their environments. Say goodbye to Excel spreadsheets and paper sheetsâ€”everything is digitalized and accessible right from your phone! Haven't I convinced you yet why you should use our product?

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. Minimize paperwork, maximize passion.
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over again.
* You should always try to make your life easier ðŸ˜„
  
Of course, no one system will suit all projects since your needs may differ. We'll be adding more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to everyone who has contributed to expanding this project!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This system is designed to manage various aspects of a sports league effectively and securely. Users are assigned different roles (Admin, Captain, Referee), each with specific permissions that dictate their available actions within the system.

- **Admins** have full access to all functionalities. They can create new leagues and teams, generate detailed reports, edit team and player information, manage players, change match schedules, generate announcements on the forum, update match statistics, and evaluate referee performance.
- **Captains** can manage and edit their respective teams and players. They have permissions to update their team data, manage team members, and provide feedback on referees' performance. Captains do not have access to league creation, report generation, or schedule changes.
- **Referees** have restricted access primarily focused on match-related functionalities. They can modify match schedules, generate forum posts (such as updates on match timings), and update match statistics. Referees do not have permissions to create leagues, teams, or generate reports.

This comprehensive set of features ensures that each user can efficiently perform their role within the system, facilitating smooth and organized management of the sports league. The system's security measures protect against unauthorized access, and its scalability allows for adjustments based on the league's needs. Additionally, the system is designed to be user-friendly and compliant with relevant regulations, including data protection laws.
